# Ghost Busting Device

**EE2028 Final Project – NUS Electrical Engineering**

A Ghost Busting device built with an STM32 microcontroller and multiple sensors to detect paranormal activity.

## Features
- **OLED Display:** Shows ghost status (`Detected / Ready to be Busted / Busted`).
- **Buzzer Alerts:** Sound notification for ghost detection and busting.
- **Sensors Used:** Temperature, humidity, and magnetic intensity sensors to detect ghost activity.
- **Auto Calibration:** Sensors are automatically calibrated on device startup to prevent erroneous readings.

## Project Structure
- **Hardware:** STM32L4 Discovery kit.
- **Software:** STM32 code including sensor readings, display, and buzzer control.
- **Videos:** Demo videos of the device.

## How to Run
1. Flash the STM32 with the provided firmware.
2. Connect all sensors as per the wiring diagram.
3. Power on the device – OLED will display ghost status, and buzzer alerts will activate accordingly.
